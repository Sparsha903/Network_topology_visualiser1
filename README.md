## 📌 Project Overview

The **Network Topology Visualizer** is a Python-based web application that scans a local network, detects active devices, and visually represents the network structure using an interactive topology graph.

This project is developed as an **academic mini-project** to demonstrate practical implementation of computer networking concepts such as IP addressing, ICMP, and network topology.
